# cointracker-demo

A simple demo designed to replicate some of the functionality of [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io/).

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Running the Client

1. Follow the steps to install Dart [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
   - **Note:** You may need to install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) if using Mac or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) if using Windows.
2. Follow the steps to install Flutter [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
   - **Note:** For Windows, I found [this resource](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-and-configure-flutter-sdk-windows-10/) to be better than the Flutter webpage for installation instructions.
3. Go to the client directory by running `cd ./client`.
4. Call `flutter run` to run the client as a standalone application or `flutter run -d chrome` to run in a web browser.

### Running the Server

1. Follow the steps to install Go [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. Go to the server directory by running `cd ./server`.
3. Before running the server, validate that port 8080 on your local machine is available.
4. Call `go run ./server.go` to run the server.
